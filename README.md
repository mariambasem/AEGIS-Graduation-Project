# AEGIS

AI-Enhanced Guardian for IoT Security — the integrated runtime of the AEGIS framework for medical IoT networks. This repository hosts the backend, the AI detection ensemble, the operator dashboard, the mitigation engine, and the Raspberry Pi gateway reference implementation.

## Contributions

1. **FastAPI backend** — REST and WebSocket service that ingests decrypted telemetry from the Pi gateway, runs every flow through the AI ensemble, evaluates mitigation policy, and streams live state to the dashboard. Includes a HIPAA-aligned append-only audit log compliant with 45 CFR §164.312(b).

2. **AI detection ensemble** — three-model architecture combining a Random Forest classifier (96.32% accuracy on known classes), a CNN-LSTM hybrid for sequential patterns, and an Autoencoder zero-day detector trained on benign-only traffic. Ensemble accuracy 96.08% on CICIoMT2024 with 100% detection on held-out classes and 99.1% cross-domain detection on CICIoT2023.

3. **Operator dashboard** — React/TypeScript single-page application with eight specialised views (Overview, Alerts, Network Map, Devices, Detection Engine, Response, Crypto Health, Reports), live WebSocket updates, and one-click operator override.

4. **Mitigation engine** — four-tier graded escalation (LOG_ONLY → RATE_LIMIT → SESSION_REKEY → DEVICE_ISOLATE) with a three-strike confirmation gate that prevents single misclassification from impacting clinical care. 11 test cases with 35 of 35 assertions passing.

5. **Pi gateway reference implementation** — Python wrapper scripts matching the production scripts deployed on the two Raspberry Pi 4 gateways, including MQTT subscriber, simulated publisher, tamper tester, and self-test for `libaegiscrypto.so`.
